      <p>StudentEats is a blog run by two Wilfrid Laurier University students that aim to supply healthy and affordable meal ideas to students. At StudentEats we believe that all students should be eating a full set of meals, that is why we supply students with four different meal selections: breakfast, lunch, dinner, and a snack option to be enjoyed whenever you feel like a nibble. Furthermore, At StudentEats we aim to please all audiences with our food ideas. That is why we have produced vegetarian options in all of our sections. We hope you enjoy the meals that are currently offered and can promise you that we look to expand to more great meal ideas in the near future. </p>
	<h3>About the people behind StudentEats</h3>
		
      <p><h4>Nathan</h4>a 5th arts student minoring in geography. Nathan is a frequent gym goer that enjoys a generally healthy lifestyle. A native of the Waterloo, Nathan has been around K-W for most of his life. Nathans favorite meal would be a meaty steak, but a cheeky bit of ice cream is the cheat meal of choice.</p>
      <p><h4>James</h4>Born in raised in KW. A Financial math major, computer science minor. I love food. I am not always the healthiest eater, but I try. But honestly I would rather have a nice glass of red with dinner then a smoothie. Lately I’ve been interested in french pastry, I took a course on making macarons. It is quite more involved and precise then anything I’ve ever tried to make but I’d say it is my favourite thing lately because if you do it right you get macarons :)</p>
